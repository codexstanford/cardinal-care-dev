This is a guide for collecting data on age limits for vaccines covered by a policy.

1. Observe the policy wording, cardinal care says the following:
Subject to any age limits provided for in the comprehensive
guidelines supported by Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. 
This gives us two pieces of information
 - a) the names of the organizations we need to use to find data and
 b) The policy only cares about "age limits" - this means we can ignore other sources
 of limits such as number of days between doses.
 2. Refer to the organizations mentioned in the policy doc to get detailed information
 on age limits. For hep_b these are at: 
 https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-schedule-notes.html#note-hepb - for children
 and 
 https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/adult-schedule-notes.html#note-hepb - for adults
 I recommend creating a spreadsheet to track limits - for hep_b I used:
https://office365stanford-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/lalwani_stanford_edu/Documents/vaccine%20schedules.xlsx?d=wba52d2d17a1c4bde9e5cdd104debf400&csf=1&web=1&e=B91e0K&nav=MTVfezAwMDAwMDAwLTAwMDEtMDAwMC0wMDAwLTAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMH0
3. Now, I describe how I derived the rules for the hep-b case.
The child schedule mentions: 
Administration of 4 doses is permitted when a combination vaccine containing HepB is used after the birth dose.
Final (3rd or 4th) dose: age 6–18 months (minimum age 24 weeks)
This implies you can have a limit of 2 doses up to the age of 6 months, which increases to 3 a combination vaccine containing HepB is used after the birth dose.
After the age of 6 months, you can take the final dose which implies the above limit increases by one.
For adults the policy states: Age 19 through 59 years: complete a 2- or 3- or 4-dose series
Hence, the limit for doses becomes 4 unconditionally after the age of 18 (there is a similar rule for 18 year olds)


Post-vaccination serology testing and revaccination (if anti-HBs<10mlU/mL) is recommended for certain populations, including:
Infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers
Persons who are predialysis or on maintenance dialysis
Other immunocompromised persons
For detailed revaccination recommendations, see http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hepb.html.

After combing through the documents at the above link, I found the following details:
- single-dose revaccination for infants born to HBsAg-positive women not responding to the initial vaccine series;
- postvaccination serologic testing 1–2 months after the final dose of vaccine is recommended for certain persons following vaccination 
(e.g., hemodialysis patients, HIV-infected and other immunocompromised persons, health care personnel, and sex partners of HBsAg-positive persons)
- Revaccination may consist of administration of a second complete HepB vaccine series
- Administration of more than two complete HepB vaccine series is generally not recommended, except for hemodialysis patients

Thus, (if anti-HBs<10mlU/mL), the limit for infants born to HBsAg-positive women increases to 5.
For other cases eligible for revaccination (HIV-infected and other immunocompromised persons, health care personnel, and sex partners of HBsAg-positive persons) the limit increases by 4
For hemodialysis patients there is no limit

How to encode in policy: 

encode the above rules in the age_range_limit_<YOUR_VACCINE> clause.

add a new eligible service rule for your vaccine that calls age_range_limit_<YOUR_VACCINE>, refer to eligible service rules for other vaccines to understand how to implement.
